    "body": "# Mastering Pro Controls 🎛️\n\nYour Pro Controls turn Easy camara into a powerful manual camera. This guide explains each main section in simple language so you know what you are changing and why.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 White Balance (WB)\n\nWhite Balance keeps colors looking natural.\n\n- **Auto** – Good for most situations; the app chooses for you.  \n- **Manual** – Use when you want a consistent look.\n\nPresets you can tap:\n\n- **Day** – Outdoor sun  \n- **Cloudy** – Adds a bit of warmth  \n- **Tungsten** – Fixes yellow indoor light  \n- **Fluoro** – Fixes green fluorescent light  \n\n> 💡 If skin looks too blue, move temperature to the right. Too orange or yellow? Move it to the left.\n\n---\n\n## 🔆 Exposure Modes\n\nExposure controls how bright or dark your image is.\n\n- **Auto** – Camera picks shutter and ISO automatically.  \n- **M (Manual)** – You choose both shutter speed and ISO.  \n- **S (Shutter Priority)** – You fix the shutter; ISO adjusts.  \n- **ISO Mode** – You fix ISO; shutter adjusts.\n\nUse **EV Compensation** to nudge the brightness up or down without changing your base settings.\n\n> ⭐ Start with Auto + EV at 0.0. If the picture is too dark, slide EV to the right; too bright, slide left.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Focus: AF vs MF\n\n- **AF (Auto Focus)** – Tap on your subject and the app focuses there. Great for everyday use.  \n- **MF (Manual Focus)** – Use the slider to control focus for creative shots.\n\nManual focus is perfect for:\n\n- Close-up details  \n- Shooting through objects (like fences or leaves)  \n- Smooth focus pulls in video\n\n---\n\n## 🗂️ Format & Quality\n\n- **JPEG / HEIF** – Ready-to-share photos. HEIF keeps quality high with smaller file size.  \n- **RAW / ProRAW** – Maximum editing flexibility (best for advanced users).\n\n> 💡 If you are not sure, choose **HEIF**.\n\n---\n\n## 🎬 Video Settings Overview\n\nKey sections in the Video panel:\n\n- **Resolution** – 720p, 1080p, or 4K  \n- **Frame Rate** – 24, 30, or 60 fps  \n- **Codec** – H.264 (compatibility) or HEVC (quality + smaller size)  \n- **Color Profile** – SDR (normal), HDR, or Log  \n- **Bitrate** – Std, High, Max\n\nSimple starting point:\n\n- Resolution: **1080p**  \n- Frame rate: **30 fps**  \n- Codec: **HEVC**  \n- Color: **SDR**  \n- Bitrate: **High**\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Looks / LUTs\n\nLooks are instant color styles.\n\n- **None** – Clean and neutral  \n- **Warm Classic** – Cozy, warm tones  \n- **Soft Pastel** – Gentle, low-contrast look  \n- **Cinematic Teal** – Movie-style teal and orange\n\nUse the **Strength** slider to control how strong the look is.\n\n> 💡 For natural results, keep strength around 30–60%.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Monitoring Tools\n\nYou can choose what to display while shooting:\n\n- **Histogram** – Shows brightness distribution  \n- **Waveform** – More detailed brightness and color  \n- **Audio** – Live sound levels\n\nTry leaving **Histogram** on while you learn. A big spike on the far right means highlights may be clipping.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Simple Pro Setup\n\n1. Set **Resolution** to 1080p and **Frame Rate** to 30 fps.  \n2. Use **Auto** exposure at first.  \n3. Turn on **Histogram**.  \n4. Choose **Warm Classic** LUT at 40–50% strength.  \n5. Use **AF**, but switch to **MF** for close-ups.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**: \"Best Settings for Daylight Photos\" →"

    "body": "# Understanding ISO, Shutter Speed & Exposure 📚\n\nExposure is how bright or dark your photo or video looks. In Easy camara, three main settings control it: **ISO**, **Shutter Speed**, and **EV Compensation**.\n\n---\n\n## 🔢 ISO\n\nISO is the sensor's sensitivity to light.\n\n- **Low ISO (30–100)** – Clean image, less noise, but needs more light.  \n- **High ISO (800–3000+)** – Works in darker scenes but adds grain/noise.\n\n> 💡 Use the lowest ISO you can while still getting a bright enough image.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱️ Shutter Speed\n\nShutter speed controls **how long** the sensor collects light.\n\n- **Fast shutter** (1/500s, 1/1000s) – Freezes motion, less light.  \n- **Slow shutter** (1/30s, 1/15s) – More motion blur, more light.\n\nFor video, a common rule:\n\n- Shutter ≈ **1 / (2 × frame rate)**  \n  - 24 fps → ~1/48 or 1/50  \n  - 30 fps → ~1/60  \n  - 60 fps → ~1/120\n\nThis gives natural-looking motion.\n\n---\n\n## 🎚️ EV Compensation\n\nEV Compensation adjusts brightness **after** the camera suggests an exposure.\n\n- **Positive EV (+)** – Brighter image.  \n- **Negative EV (–)** – Darker image.\n\nUse this instead of constantly changing ISO or shutter if you are in Auto modes.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How They Work Together\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n- ISO = How sensitive your \"eyes\" are.  \n- Shutter = How long your \"eyes stay open\".  \n- EV = Fine-tuning the final brightness.\n\nTo fix a dark photo:\n\n1. Lower shutter speed (if subject is not moving fast).  \n2. Raise ISO slightly.  \n3. Add a bit of positive EV.\n\nTo fix a photo that is too bright:\n\n1. Increase shutter speed.  \n2. Reduce ISO.  \n3. Add a bit of negative EV.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Simple Practice Exercise\n\n1. Point the camera at a window or bright scene.  \n2. Switch to **Manual (M)** mode.  \n3. Set ISO low and adjust shutter until the image looks good.  \n4. Then raise ISO and see how the histogram and noise change.\n\nNotice how each control changes the look.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**: \"Manual Focus: When & How to Use It\" →"

    "body": "# Manual Focus: When & How to Use It 🎯\n\nAuto Focus is fast and smart, but sometimes you want full control. Manual Focus (MF) lets you decide exactly **what** should be sharp.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 Switching to Manual Focus\n\n1. Open **Pro Controls**.  \n2. In the **Focus** section, choose **MF**.  \n3. Use the **focus slider** to move focus from near to far.\n\nWatch the preview and stop when your subject looks sharp.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 When Manual Focus Is Better\n\nUse MF when:\n\n- The camera keeps focusing on the wrong object.  \n- You are shooting **macro** or very close details.  \n- You want a cinematic **focus pull** between two subjects.  \n- It is very dark and AF struggles.\n\n---\n\n## 🎥 Doing a Focus Pull\n\n1. Set your subject A (foreground) and subject B (background).  \n2. Start with focus on A using the slider.  \n3. Begin recording.  \n4. Slowly slide focus toward B while keeping your hand steady.\n\nThis simple move instantly looks more professional.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Macro & Detail Shots\n\nFor close-up shots (flowers, textures, objects):\n\n- Move your phone **as close as it can still focus**.  \n- Switch to MF and fine-tune until the tiny details pop.  \n- Keep the phone very steady or use a small tripod.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Manual Focus Checklist\n\n- Always zoom in a bit (digitally) to check if focus is truly sharp, then zoom back.  \n- Combine MF with **grid** overlay to align your subject.  \n- Practice small slider movements; big jumps look rough.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**: \"Best Settings for Low Light & Night Photos\" →"

    "body": "# Complete Mobile Filmmaking Tips 🎥📱\n\nNow that you know the tools inside Easy camara, this guide ties everything together into a simple workflow you can use for vlogs, short films, or travel videos.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 1. Plan Before You Shoot\n\nYou do not need a big script, just a clear idea:\n\n- What is this video about?  \n- Who or what is the main subject?  \n- Where will you shoot it?  \n- How long should it be?\n\nMake a quick shot list:\n\n- Wide shot  \n- Medium shot  \n- Close-up  \n- Extra details (hands, environment, objects)\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ 2. Set Up Your Camera Once\n\nBefore recording:\n\n- Choose **Resolution**, **Frame Rate**, and **Codec** for the whole project.  \n- Pick one **LUT** (or None) and stick with it.  \n- Lock **White Balance** for consistency.  \n- Turn on **Histogram** to avoid clipping.\n\nThis keeps all clips looking like they belong in the same story.\n\n---\n\n## 🔆 3. Light Is Everything\n\n- Prefer **natural light** near windows or outdoors.  \n- Avoid strong mixed lighting (daylight + green fluorescent).  \n- At night, move your subject closer to the brightest light source.\n\nRemember: it is easier to make a well-lit shot more dramatic than to rescue a dark, noisy one.\n\n---\n\n## 🎙 4. Treat Audio Seriously\n\n- Watch the **audio meters**; aim for around –12 dB to –6 dB.  \n- Record in a quiet place when possible.  \n- Get the phone closer to the sound source instead of shouting.\n\nGood audio makes your video feel professional even if the visuals are simple.\n\n---\n\n## 🎬 5. Shoot in Pieces, Not in One Take\n\nFor each moment:\n\n1. Start with a **wide shot** to show context.  \n2. Capture a **medium shot** of the subject.  \n3. Grab **close-ups** of faces, hands, or important details.  \n4. Add a few **cutaway shots** (sky, buildings, background people).\n\nThese pieces give you flexibility when editing.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 6. Keep the Story Clear\n\nEven short clips should have:\n\n- A **beginning** (where are we? who is here?)  \n- A **middle** (what happens?)  \n- An **end** (what changed or what did we learn?)\n\nThink about what you want viewers to **feel** at the end.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ 7. Simple Workflow Summary\n\n1. Plan your story and shot list.  \n2. Set Pro Controls once at the start.  \n3. Use stable handholding or support surfaces.  \n4. Watch exposure, focus, and audio meters.  \n5. Shoot multiple angles of each moment.  \n6. Keep clips short and intentional.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**: Explore other guides in the **Guide Library** or re-read any topic you want to practice again. Easy camara will grow with your skills. 🌟"
